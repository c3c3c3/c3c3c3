- 👋 Hi, I’m Viktor I'm 24 and I love avocado (by coincidence, it's green - at least, some of them)
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis via SQL & pandas (actually, I'm capable of using bot of them since they perform the same)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data analysis (again, green. Do you see this logical chain?)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some music industry-related project since I'm into this domain
